** This secondary iteration adds the ability to analyze and create data modeling of transaction histories to the V.1 model

** In a typical Solana application, transaction history is not stored in the application itself, but rather fetched from the Solana blockchain as needed. This is usually done through the Solana RPC API, which provides various methods to query transaction history for a given account or signature.

However, if you're building a Rust-based application and want to keep an internal record of transaction history, you can do so. Below is an example that extends the previous code to store transaction history in a simple in-memory data structure:

To begin, define a struct for transaction history:


#[derive(Debug)]
struct TransactionRecord {
    signature: String,
    instruction: PublicGoodsInstruction,
    involved_accounts: Vec<Pubkey>,
}

** Next extend the main function to store processed transactions in a vector:

extern crate solana_sdk;

use solana_sdk::{
    transaction::Transaction,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
};
use std::str::FromStr;
use std::collections::HashMap;

const PUBLIC_GOODS_PROGRAM_ID: &str = "YourPublicGoodsProgramIDHere";

#[derive(Debug)]
enum PublicGoodsInstruction {
    Donate { amount: u64 },
    Withdraw { amount: u64 },
}

impl PublicGoodsInstruction {
    pub fn unpack(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, String> {
        let (&tag, rest) = input.split_first().ok_or("input is too short")?;
        Ok(match tag {
            0 => PublicGoodsInstruction::Donate { amount: u64::from_le_bytes(rest.try_into().map_err(|_| "buffer too short")?) },
            1 => PublicGoodsInstruction::Withdraw { amount: u64::from_le_bytes(rest.try_into().map_err(|_| "buffer too short")?) },
            _ => return Err("Unknown tag".to_string()),
        })
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct TransactionRecord {
    signature: String,
    instruction: PublicGoodsInstruction,
    involved_accounts: Vec<Pubkey>,
}

fn main() {
    // Replace this with your actual serialized transaction data
    let serialized_tx: Vec<u8> = vec![];

    // Deserialize the transaction
    let transaction: Transaction = bincode::deserialize(&serialized_tx).unwrap();

    // A HashMap to store the transaction history
    let mut tx_history: HashMap<String, TransactionRecord> = HashMap::new();

    // Print out some basic information
    println!("Transaction Signature: {:?}", transaction.signatures);

    // Iterate over the instructions inside the transaction
    for instruction in &transaction.message.instructions {
        println!("Program ID Index: {:?}", instruction.program_id_index);

        // Get the actual program ID (Pubkey)
        let program_id: Pubkey = transaction.message.account_keys[instruction.program_id_index as usize];
        println!("Actual Program ID: {:?}", program_id);

        // If the program ID matches the Public Goods program, decode it
        if program_id == Pubkey::from_str(PUBLIC_GOODS_PROGRAM_ID).unwrap() {
            match PublicGoodsInstruction::unpack(&instruction.data) {
                Ok(public_goods_instruction) => {
                    println!("Public Goods Instruction: {:?}", public_goods_instruction);

                    // Decode the involved accounts
                    let mut involved_accounts: Vec<Pubkey> = Vec::new();
                    for account_index in &instruction.accounts {
                        let involved_account: Pubkey = transaction.message.account_keys[*account_index as usize];
                        println!("Involved Account: {:?}", involved_account);
                        involved_accounts.push(involved_account);
                    }

                    // Store this transaction in the history
                    let signature = transaction.signatures[0].to_string();
                    tx_history.insert(
                        signature.clone(),
                        TransactionRecord {
                            signature,
                            instruction: public_goods_instruction.clone(),
                            involved_accounts,
                        },
                    );
                },
                Err(err) => {
                    println!("Failed to unpack Public Goods instruction: {:?}", err);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the transaction history
    println!("Transaction History: {:?}", tx_history);
}

**  this example uses a 'HashMap' to store the transaction history. The key is the transaction signature, and the value is a struct ('TransactionRecord') containing details about the transaction.

** This is an in-memory data structure; if the application restarts, the history will be lost. In a real-world application,it would be more practical to persist this data to a database or some other form of storage.

** The dependencies remain the same as the V.1 parse

[dependencies]
solana-sdk = "1.9.0"

** This is a very basic example of assessing transaction history within the application. In a real-world application, one would likely wish to add more features, such as pagination, filtering, and persistent storage.
